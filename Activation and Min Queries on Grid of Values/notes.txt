It seemed clear that the crux of a more optimal solution would reducing the n*m operation of minimum calculation for each query. I even had a bit of a reference to this in the original code with the unused "minLoc = [42, None]". The constraints given in the problem had n and m relatively fixed with q being able to keep growing. So some sort of memoization needs to be employed, but I have not been able to find a way to implement it that doesn't involve recalculating minimums when a row or column is deactivated.
