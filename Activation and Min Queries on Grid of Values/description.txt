You are given n and m representing the dimensions of an n X m one indexed grid. Each cell has a value equal to the product of its indexes. All cells start as active. Given an array of queries where the query [0] returns the minimum value among active cells, the query [1, i] deactives all cells in row i, and the query [2, j] deactives all cells in column j, return all results of the [0] queries.
